## API Keys

All API requests require an API key for authentication. You can create and manage API keys in your [Dashboard](https://gistmag.co.uk/dashboard/api-key).

## Using Your API Key

### Method 1: Request Body (Recommended)

Include your API key in the request body:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gistmag.co.uk/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
    "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
  }'
```

### Method 2: Query Parameter

For GET requests, you can include the API key as a query parameter:

```bash
curl "https://api.gistmag.co.uk/usage?api_key=your_api_key_here"
```

## Multiple API Keys

You can create multiple API keys for different projects or environments. Each key has its own usage tracking and can be managed independently.

<Info>
  API keys are scoped to your account. All keys have access to the same features based on your subscription tier.
</Info>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Never commit API keys to version control.** Use environment variables or secure secret management.
</Warning>

### Using Environment Variables

```bash
export GISTMAG_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
curl -X POST https://api.gistmag.co.uk/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"api_key\": \"$GISTMAG_API_KEY\",
    \"image_url\": \"https://example.com/image.jpg\"
  }"
```

### Rotating API Keys

Regularly rotate your API keys for security:

1. Create a new API key in your dashboard
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Delete the old key once migration is complete

## Verifying Your API Key

You can verify your API key is valid using the verify endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gistmag.co.uk/verify-key \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
  }'
```
