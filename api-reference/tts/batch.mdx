description: "Process long text efficiently with automatic chunking"
api: "POST /tts/batch"

## Overview

Process long text efficiently by automatically splitting it into chunks and combining the audio with pauses between segments. Ideal for long-form content like articles, books, or documentation.

<Endpoint method="post" url="/tts/batch" />

## Request Body

<ParamField body="text" type="string" required>
  The text to convert to speech. Can be very long (10,000+ characters).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="en">
  Language code (e.g., "en", "es", "fr")
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pause_duration" type="number" default="800">
  Pause duration in milliseconds between text segments
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="api_key" type="string" required>
  Your GistMag API key
</ParamField>

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gistmag.co.uk/tts/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "This is a very long text that will be automatically split into chunks...",
    "language": "en",
    "pause_duration": 800,
    "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
  }' \
  --output output.mp3
```

## How It Works

1. Text is automatically split at sentence boundaries
2. Each segment is processed independently
3. Audio segments are combined with pauses between them
4. Final audio is normalized and exported as MP3

## Response

The response is a single MP3 audio file containing the complete text with natural pauses.

**Content-Type**: `audio/mpeg`

**Content-Disposition**: `attachment; filename=output.mp3`

## Credit Cost

**1 credit per 1,000 characters**, with a **minimum of 1 credit** for any request.

### Examples:
- 10 characters = **1 credit** (minimum charge)
- 500 characters = **1 credit** (minimum charge)
- 1,000 characters = **1 credit**
- 2,500 characters = **3 credits** (rounded up)
- 10,000 characters = **10 credits**

## Example Usage

### Python

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.gistmag.co.uk/tts/batch",
    json={
        "text": "Very long text here...",
        "language": "en",
        "pause_duration": 800,
        "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
    }
)

with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

<Info>
  Batch processing is more efficient for long text as it handles chunking and combining automatically, ensuring natural pauses between sentences.
