- High-quality, natural-sounding speech
- Multiple neural voices per language
- Control over speaking rate, pitch, and volume
- Fast, scalable generation with Google Cloud infrastructure

### Speech-to-Text
The API uses **OpenAI Whisper API** for STT, which provides:

- High-accuracy transcription with automatic language detection
- Support for many audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, etc.)
- Multi-language support with automatic language detection
- Robust handling of various accents and audio qualities

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gistmag.co.uk/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Hello, this is a test of the text-to-speech API.",
    "language": "en",
    "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
  }'
```

The response will be an audio file that you can download or play directly.
