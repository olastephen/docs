2. The plugin will download the image and set it as your post's featured image
3. The page will refresh to show the new featured image

### Auto-Apply Feature

If you enable **Auto-Apply Results** in the plugin settings, the generated excerpt, category, and tags will be automatically applied to your post when generation completes.

## Image Styles

- **Realistic**: Photorealistic images that look like real photographs
- **Illustration**: Artistic illustrations and drawings
